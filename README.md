# Call-by-value
## EXPERIMENT 10

## Aim:
To perform call by value function 

## Apparatus:
VS Code

## Theory
## PASS BY VALUE 
Pass by Value is a method of argument passing in programming where a function receives a copy of the argument's value which means that any changes made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function.


## PASS BY REFRENCE
Pass by Reference is a method of argument passing where a function receives a reference to the actual argument that means that the function operates directly on the original data, and changes made to the parameter inside the function will affect the original variable.


## Algorithm
## Pass by Value



## Pass by refrence


## Conclusion
In this experiment we learned call by value function
